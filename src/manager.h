 * Assignment:
 * HW5 final project
 * All of the business logic is in the Manager class.
 * The manager creates and manages a list of clients using a binary search tree (so lookups are performed in O(NlogN) time.
 * When printed, the clients are traversed in-order (ascending by client ID).
 * The manager will handle sensitive information such as loading clients from a input stream.
 * The manager can create accounts for clients and perform any necessary transactions; successfully performed transactions are recorded in clientâ€™s transaction history.
 * The manager also records successful transactions in and an undo deque.
 * The manager keeps track of the transactions in case a client wants to "undo" the most recent transaction or "redo" the most recent undone transaction.
 * The manager is friend to Client and Account and is the only entity that can perform sensitive operations.

 * The manager can undo the most recent transaction and redo the most recent undone transaction.
 * After perform all the transactions we display the client with their account before any transactions were performed and
 * when all the transactions have been perform we show the clients with their adjusted accounts, and each of their transaction performed.
